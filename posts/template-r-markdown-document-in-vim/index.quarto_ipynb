        "In my last post, I wrote about an R Markdown centered data analysis workflow that I found to be helpful for many of my work. Helpful, in terms of improving code reusability and remembering what has been done for a particular project. Idea is that I'd start any (ad-hoc) data analysis project with a home Rmd document to store both codes and narratives. \n",

        "It followed naturally that I soon started hoping to start a new Rmd document with some predefined default setting in Vim, e.g., metadata such as title, date, and output options, etc., as well as R packages that I'd use all the time. I knew RStudio IDE provides template functionality, but I wanted to be able to do it in the tool/environment that I spend most time in daily. So I started looking around, and quickly ran into several blog posts on how to use Vim templates^[I followed this blog [post](https://shapeshed.com/vim-templates/) on how to use Vim templates].\n",
