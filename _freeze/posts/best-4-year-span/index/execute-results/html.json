Say hello to: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane :) \n\nBefore writing about the other end of the spectrum in series history, I started reading the 2009 champion season book, \"One Fantastic Ride: The Inside Story of Carolina Basketball's 2009 Championship Season\" and posted about it on twitter: \"Re-reading my fav 4 seasons of all time in @UNC_Basketball (so far) while waiting on the latest by the great @jadamlucas #uncmbbtrivia\". \n\nIt is indeed my favorite 4 years of UNC MBB history so far, because to me the 4-year span has everything the college basketball represents: new kids on campus --> massive development --> fall from the highest stage --> redemption and championship. \n\nI became curious how accomplished the core members of the championship team were and if there's any other teams comparable to the 2005 freshmen group. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/best_class-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/best5-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n",
