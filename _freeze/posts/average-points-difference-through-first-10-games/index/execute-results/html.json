All I have to do was to change the current number of game (from 5 to 10) and re-run the script.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Average points difference through season's first 10 games</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Rank </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Season </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Tm </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Opp </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Avg_Diff </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2018 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Western Carolina </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 104 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 61 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 26 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2018 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Western Carolina </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 104 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 61 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe impact of the first loss of the season to Spartans is evident, as the running average dropped significantly from the 5th to the 6th game, which was the lost game. With the last game win against Western Carolina, the running average gained a good momentum, and the average through the season's first 10 games sits at 24 out of 69 seasons since 1949-50 season.\n\nJust for fun, let's see how bad the loss was in terms of its impact to the running average since 1949-50 season. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>6th games impact to points difference running average</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Season </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent_School </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Tm </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Opp </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> diffavg </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> diffavg_prev1 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> delta_p1 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1965 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Indiana </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 81 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 107 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8.666667 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15.6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -6.933333 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2003 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Illinois </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 65 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 92 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7.166667 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14.0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -6.833333 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1951 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Eastern Kentucky </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 62 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 85 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.333333 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15.8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -6.466667 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2018 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Michigan State </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 63 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13.000000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -6.200000 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2018 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Michigan StateÂ (4) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 63 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13.000000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -6.200000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo the loss to Spartans was one of the worst, measured by the changes to the points difference running average between 5th and 6th games, dropping the season average by more than 6 points. It's probably not the most interesting number to quote to gauge how bad the game actually was, and many historic (and more intereting) low records have been already covered for the game. \n\nGood news is that the running average is increaing sharply after a trio of relatively on-par performances since the loss until the Western Carolina game, in which we played so well that many historic high records have been produced. \n\n",
