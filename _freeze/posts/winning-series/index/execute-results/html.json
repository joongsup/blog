Frankly I was initially curious which schools have winning series against UNC and found out which (and here's the link to that [post](http://uncmbbtrivia.netlify.com/post/losing-series/)), but to start off things on a positive note :) I'm posting which schools have never won against UNC since 1949-50 season while having played UNC at least 10 times. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: `mutate_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nℹ Please use `mutate()` instead.\nℹ See vignette('programming') for more help\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the jutilr package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hardest-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere they are: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane! Two of these teams are on UNC's schedule for upcoming 2017-2018 season, so it'll be interesting to see if UNC can keep the winning streak. \n\n\n\n",
