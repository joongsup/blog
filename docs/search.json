    "text": "As I mentioned it in an earlier post, I’ve been wanting to add each season’s players info to my data source. Although it needs more cleaning still, I finally got around to it and got to play with the players data a bit lately.\nAs part of cleaning the players data, I needed to make sure that for most players, their college careers lasted at most for four years. At one end of the extreme sit those one-and-done players (e.g., Tony Bradley, Marvin Williams); at the other end are the 5th year players.\nFresh in memory from reading the 2009 championship book (“One Fantastic Ride”) by Adam Lucas, I knew about Marcus Ginyard’s case. He hurted one of his legs early in his senior season and sat out the remainder of what turned out to be the championship season. Also I remember reading an article about Stilman White taking a mission trip while in college. I was curious if there were other players like them.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nfirst_yr\nlast_yr\nnote\n\n\n\n\nTony Radovich\n1953\n1957\nSomehow played for 5 seasons.\n\n\nGeoff Crompton\n1974\n1978\nRedshirted 2nd year.\n\n\nWarren Martin\n1982\n1986\nRedshirted 3rd year.\n\n\nCurtis Hunter\n1983\n1987\nRedshirted 2nd year.\n\n\nKevin Madden\n1986\n1990\nRedshirted 2nd year.\n\n\nPat Sullivan\n1991\n1995\nRedshirted 4th year.\n\n\nBrian Bersticker\n1998\n2002\nRedshirted 3rd year due to an injury.\n\n\nOrlando Melendez\n1998\n2002\nRedshirted 1st year due to a foot injury.\n\n\nMarcus Ginyard\n2006\n2010\nRedshirted 4th year due to a foot injury.\n\n\nLeslie McDonald\n2010\n2014\nRedshirted 3rd year due to a knee injury.\n\n\nStilman White\n2012\n2017\nAfter 1st year, spent 2 years in mission trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than the three most recent players on the list (e.g., White, McDonald, and Ginyard), I had no idea who the remaining eight players were, thus needing googling and cross checking various sources I could find online. It was not a very comprehensive searching effort, but not surprisingly, this quick researching revealed that many of them took a year off due to injuries of various kinds, although it was hard to find exactly what kinds of injuries led players to redshirt a year expecially for those who played in pre 90s.\nBest of luck to the players in the 2017-18 roster who open the season this Friday, and let’s hope for an injury-free and awesome season (knocking on wood)!"

    "text": "Time flies, and the Tar Heels played the season’s first 5 games already. And loosely speaking, they’ve played well so far (knocking on woods), to the eyes of just another casual fan here!\nI’m not going to say anything about this season’s fate based on the results of the season’s first 5 games, but still I was curious how well this season compares to other seasons at this point. There could be many different ways to do just that, but I thought looking at each season’s running average of points difference after each regular season game might be interesting.\nLooking through the 5th game of each season, the current season sits at 19th out of total 69 seasons since 1949-50 campaign as it shows in the next table. Also note that 3 of the top 6 seasons in the table (2017, 1993, and 2009) were championship winning seasons.\n\n\n\nAverage points difference through season's first 5 games (showing 5th game opponent)\n\n\nRank\nSeason\nOpponent\nTm\nOpp\nAvg_Diff\n\n\n\n\n1\n2019\nSaint Francis\n101\n76\n30.6\n\n\n2\n2017\nChaminade\n104\n61\n28.8\n\n\n3\n1998\nSeton Hall\n95\n65\n28.4\n\n\n4\n1973\nKentucky\n78\n70\n27.6\n\n\n5\n1993\nHouston\n84\n76\n27.6\n\n\n6\n1987\nMiami\n122\n77\n26.8\n\n\n7\n2009\nOregon\n98\n69\n25.0\n\n\n8\n1992\nSeton Hall\n83\n54\n24.8\n\n\n9\n1970\nVirginia\n80\n76\n24.2\n\n\n10\n1974\nEast Tennessee State\n81\n63\n23.4\n\n\n11\n1986\nNevada-Las Vegas\n65\n60\n23.4\n\n\n12\n1991\nConnecticut\n79\n64\n23.4\n\n\n13\n1976\nEast Tennessee State\n104\n67\n23.0\n\n\n14\n1972\nWake Forest\n99\n76\n22.6\n\n\n15\n2008\nBrigham Young\n73\n63\n22.4\n\n\n16\n2012\nSouth Carolina\n87\n62\n22.4\n\n\n17\n1967\nNew York University\n95\n58\n22.0\n\n\n18\n1969\nClemson\n90\n69\n19.4\n\n\n19\n2004\nGeorge Mason\n115\n81\n19.2\n\n\n20\n2018\nArkansas\n87\n68\n19.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the running average of points difference each season, it seems to be stablizing after first couple of games each season.

Wonder what was all that about. A quick search didn’t turn up anything about the specifics of those two games, but a gentle reminder that 1961-62 season was coach Smith’s first season at Carolina. I like running into things like this while exploring the match data :) (and what about those pairs of NC State/Duke games in 1954-55 and 1955-56 seasons!?)\nNext, I became curious what’s the most frequent pair of game days. Easily weekends must be the most frequent game days, I guessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I was half right, because the Tar Heels indeed played the most on Saturdays, but the next most frequent game day was Wednesdays. I wonder if there’s any particular reason as to why Wednesdays have seen unusually many game actions compared to other weekdays.\nIn any case, the two observations seem to match, i.e., (1) two consecutive regular season games were played 3 days apart mostly, and (2) the games were played on Wed and Sat mostly. However, a Wed game may or may not have been followed by a Saturday game, nor a Saturday game may or may not have followed the previous Wed game. So I was wondering if indeed the two game days (Wed and Sat) are the most frequent consecutive game days.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'last_dy'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo indeed, Wed/Sat (3-day apart) was the most frequent game day pair, followed by Sat/Wed (4-day apart) pair. Below chart shows the same thing, with each row representing previous game day vs. each folumn the next game day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo then what about the results of those games played after a long break?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor games at least 10 days apart, Tar Heels won both games right before and after breaks mostly. For example, for consecutive games that are exacxtly 10 days apart, 6 times (purple fill) we won both the last game before the break and the first game after the break, and one time (green fill) we lost the last game before the break and won the first game after the break.\nNow for Sunday’s game against Tennessee, with 11 days apart from last game, we have a chance to even the results. So far 3 times (turquoise) we won the last game before the break and lost in the first game after the break, and 2 times (purple) we won both the last game before the break and the first game after the break."

    "text": "In my first uncmbbtrivia post last week, I looked at perfect winning series of UNC MBB team, particularly looking for those schools that the team has never lost to since 1949-50 season (minimum of 10 games). Again, say hello to: Citadel, Rutgers, Stanford, and Tulane :)\nThis week, I look at the opposite end of the series history. Are there any schools that the UNC MBB team kept losing to? I know we haven’t been playing particularly well against Duke lately, so at least I knew depending on how far back I go that there will be some schools that we have losing series against.\nHow about perfect losing series? I was thinking, ok there might be some schools that have winning series aginst us, but there’s no way that there’s a school that UNC MBB team never won, not even one game, having played at least some number of games.\nSo to answer these questions, I crunched some numbers wrote some scripts (and I’ll write about this analysis process in near future), and below is what I got. First I look at schools that have winning series against UNC since 1949-50 season, having played UNC at least 10 times.\n\n\nWarning: `mutate_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nℹ Please use `mutate()` instead.\nℹ See vignette('programming') for more help\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the dplyr package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there they are: Indiana and Texas have winning records against UNC, having played us at least 10 times since 1949-50 season. We are not playing them this upcoming season, but as we can see in the following table, the two non-ACC teams played us quite recently, so it might take a while to be on top. Also of note is that even though we haven’t been playing well against Duke lately, we are still on top going back to 1949-50 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent_School\nfirst_game\nlast_game\ngames\nwins\nlosses\nwin_perc\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\n1961-12-11\n2016-11-30\n15\n6\n9\n0.4000\n\n\nTexas\n1992-12-05\n2018-11-22\n11\n3\n8\n0.2727\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two variables that can give different answers to the original questions than above: starting season and minimum number of games played. As I said earlier, as much as I hate to admit, I was pretty sure we were having a losing series lately against Duke, and I was curious what other schools have been relatively better than us recently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent_School\nfirst_game\nlast_game\ngames\nwins\nlosses\nwin_perc\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\n2000-01-18\n2020-02-15\n37\n18\n19\n0.4865\n\n\nKentucky\n2000-12-02\n2018-12-22\n18\n8\n10\n0.4444\n\n\nDuke\n2000-02-03\n2020-03-07\n49\n18\n31\n0.3673\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there they are: Kentucky and Duke have been relatively better than us since the beginning of the millenium, although I’d think it’s only a matter of time that we’ll be on top again in the series with Kentucky. With Duke, I’m not so sure here. Numbers look pretty bad, and it might take a while to re-gain the bragging right (ok screw it. UNC &gt; Duke always Go Heels!). I’ll have to see, but I’m pretty sure the 4 seasons from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2009 season saved us from what could have been a total embarrassment. Much more on this awesome rivalry in the future for sure.\nFinally, I was wondering if there is any school that we have never won, not even once since 1949-50 season, having played at least 2 games. It’s quite easy to do, because all I had to do was to change the variable “minimum number of games played” in the script that I used earlier. Regardless of amount of efforts involved, there shouldn’t be a school that’s having a perfect winning series against us, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent_School\nfirst_game\nlast_game\ngames\nwins\nlosses\nwin_perc\n\n\n\n\nNew York University\n1951-01-04\n1966-12-17\n7\n3\n4\n0.4286\n\n\nIndiana\n1961-12-11\n2016-11-30\n15\n6\n9\n0.4000\n\n\nDayton\n1967-03-24\n2010-04-01\n3\n1\n2\n0.3333\n\n\nTexas\n1992-12-05\n2018-11-22\n11\n3\n8\n0.2727\n\n\nIowa\n1989-01-07\n2014-12-03\n4\n1\n3\n0.2500\n\n\nNavy\n1950-12-28\n1998-03-12\n4\n1\n3\n0.2500\n\n\nWest Virginia\n1949-12-28\n1965-12-31\n5\n0\n5\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, what do I know. First of all, there are Indiana and Texas teams that I touched on in earlier part of this post (it’s sort of re-affirming to see them again in this output). Then, there go some other schools that we are having losing series records, albeit having beaten them at least once: New York University (New York University?!), Dayton, Iowa, and Navy.\nThen there is West Virgina. It turns out we have never won against West Virginia team, having played them 5 times total since 1949-50 season! Starting years were different in two cases, but it might take even longer for UNC to get even with this team than with Duke, because there’s at least two games to be played against Duke each year, whereas it seems very unlikely that we’ll see West Virginia in schedule, considering the last time we played them was on the new years eve in 1965. But what do I know. I’m just another casual fan here, trying to dig up some gems from the UNC match history data."

    "text": "This past week, I was in a presentation training, and all the participants had to select a topic on the last day of training to give a (perfect) 15-min presentation. You know, after learning all the essential presentation skills, it was time to apply those fancy skills to work!\nI decided to talk about UNC MBB and its great stories behind each of the 3 championship seasons during Williams-era. I made a 5-page deck using Rmd-driven slidy presentation, and I am planning to post it here either in its raw form or after some adjustment using xaringan.\nThe main driver of the presentation was each season’s win percentage, including all match types (regular, conference tournament, and NCAA tournament) as so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter I gave the final presentation, I realized that looking at regular season win % leading up to NCAA tournament might be also interesting, especially to say anything about each team’s performance during the regular season and its final result at NCAA tournament level. So I made a small change in my script, and below is the regular season win % since 1949-50 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere goes the perfect championship winning season in 1956-57, Dean Smith’s first championship season in 1981-82, and his second one in 1992-93 season. And there goes Roy William’s first championship season in 2004-05, second one in 2008-09 season, and last but not least, his latest in 2016-17 season. (And yes I do see that horrible deep in early 2000s.)\nThere are also some seasons that had as much success as the crowning seasons in terms of regular season win %s but without bearing the NCAA championship trophy. Looking at the top 10 seasons by the regular season win % should make it easy to identify them:\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\ngames\nwins\nlosses\npct\nchamp\n\n\n\n\n1957\n24\n24\n0\n1.0000000\nYes\n\n\n1984\n27\n26\n1\n0.9629630\nNo\n\n\n2008\n31\n29\n2\n0.9354839\nNo\n\n\n1987\n29\n27\n2\n0.9310345\nNo\n\n\n1976\n26\n24\n2\n0.9230769\nNo\n\n\n1982\n26\n24\n2\n0.9230769\nYes\n\n\n1998\n30\n27\n3\n0.9000000\nNo\n\n\n2009\n30\n27\n3\n0.9000000\nYes\n\n\n1993\n29\n26\n3\n0.8965517\nYes\n\n\n2005\n29\n26\n3\n0.8965517\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, only (?) half of the top 10 seasons with highest win % ended up with NCAA championship. Other half not-so-fortunate seasons include some that I’m familiar with (such as 2008, 1998) and others that I’m not (such as 1984, 1987, and 1976). Having players data readily available for each season could’ve made it a breeze to look into those highly successful yet not so fortunate seasons, and it’s definitely something that I’d like to add to my data source.\nAlso notable is that not all the 6 NCAA championship winning seasons are included in the list of top 10 regular season win %. Turns out the latest crowning season is not part of this elite seasons, having lost 6 games in the regular season, a feat that is not indeed so elite compared to the 5 highly successful yet unforunate seasons from above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\ngames\nwins\nlosses\npct\nchamp\n\n\n\n\n1957\n24\n24\n0\n1.0000000\nYes\n\n\n1982\n26\n24\n2\n0.9230769\nYes\n\n\n2009\n30\n27\n3\n0.9000000\nYes\n\n\n1993\n29\n26\n3\n0.8965517\nYes\n\n\n2005\n29\n26\n3\n0.8965517\nYes\n\n\n2017\n32\n26\n6\n0.8125000\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut between a highly successful regular season without trophy versus a lukewarm (I don’t know, is 26-6 a lukewarm season?) regular season with a trophy at the end? I’ll take the trophy day in and day out!"

    "text": "A quick update to the last post, where I looked at the (running) average of points difference through first 5 games then. 5 more games were played since then, so let’s look at the running average of points difference through the season’s first 10 games. All I have to do was to change the current number of game (from 5 to 10) and re-run the script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage points difference through season's first 10 games\n\n\nRank\nSeason\nOpponent\nTm\nOpp\nAvg_Diff\n\n\n\n\n25\n2018\nWestern Carolina\n104\n61\n17\n\n\n26\n2018\nWestern Carolina\n104\n61\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of the first loss of the season to Spartans is evident, as the running average dropped significantly from the 5th to the 6th game, which was the lost game. With the last game win against Western Carolina, the running average gained a good momentum, and the average through the season’s first 10 games sits at 24 out of 69 seasons since 1949-50 season.\nJust for fun, let’s see how bad the loss was in terms of its impact to the running average since 1949-50 season.\n\n\n\n6th games impact to points difference running average\n\n\nSeason\nOpponent_School\nTm\nOpp\ndiffavg\ndiffavg_prev1\ndelta_p1\n\n\n\n\n1965\nIndiana\n81\n107\n8.666667\n15.6\n-6.933333\n\n\n2003\nIllinois\n65\n92\n7.166667\n14.0\n-6.833333\n\n\n1951\nEastern Kentucky\n62\n85\n9.333333\n15.8\n-6.466667\n\n\n2018\nMichigan State\n45\n63\n13.000000\n19.2\n-6.200000\n\n\n2018\nMichigan State (4)\n45\n63\n13.000000\n19.2\n-6.200000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the loss to Spartans was one of the worst, measured by the changes to the points difference running average between 5th and 6th games, dropping the season average by more than 6 points. It’s probably not the most interesting number to quote to gauge how bad the game actually was, and many historic (and more intereting) low records have been already covered for the game.\nGood news is that the running average is increaing sharply after a trio of relatively on-par performances since the loss until the Western Carolina game, in which we played so well that many historic high records have been produced."

    "text": "UNC MBB team had its first official exhibition game of the 2017-18 season this past week against Barton college. It was the first official exhibition, because there was a scrimmage (unofficial exhibition?) with Memphis team about a week before UNC MBB faced Baron college.\nThe team’s first official regular season game is in less than 2 weeks against Northern Iowa, and just like they won the unofficial games (with questionable performance) so far, I’d expect the team to start the season with a W.\nBut then again, I’m just another casual fan here, and history might say otherwise. So I took a look at how UNC MBB played its first official games since 1949-50 season. Surely we must have won the first game of each season?\n\n\nWarning: `mutate_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nℹ Please use `mutate()` instead.\nℹ See vignette('programming') for more help\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the dplyr package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\nn\nperc\n\n\n\n\nL\n5\n0.0704225\n\n\nW\n66\n0.9295775\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we go again. Since 1949-50 season, there have been 5 seasons in which UNC MBB started a season with a L. Purely based on my memory, I knew the 2004-05 championship season started with a L against Santa Clara team, but let’s see what other seasons gave the fans rather depressing outlook for the season, albeit briefly.\n\n\n\nSeason Opener Loss\n\n\nSeason\nGame_Date\nType\nWhere\nOpponent_School\nResult\nTm\nOpp\n\n\n\n\n1966\n1965-12-01\nREG\nA\nClemson\nL\n74\n84\n\n\n1983\n1982-11-20\nREG\nN\nSt. John's\nL\n74\n78\n\n\n1997\n1996-11-22\nREG\nN\nArizona\nL\n72\n83\n\n\n2002\n2001-11-16\nREG\nH\nHampton\nL\n69\n77\n\n\n2005\n2004-11-19\nREG\nN\nSanta Clara\nL\n66\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not that familiar with 60s (and 70s) games, but it’s interesting that the 1965-66 season’s first game was against Clemson, an ACC team even back then (wasn’t sure if Clemson was in ACC back then, and found out they were). ACC confererence games don’t start until late December or early January these days, so maybe they had a different conference schedule policy back then.\n1982-83 season was a championship defending season just like upcoming 2017-18 season, and the loss against St. John’s must have given many fans an inauspicious feeling about their defending season. Let’s hope we don’t start this defending season like that, although I wouldn’t mind finishing this defending season at regional final as MJ and team did back then.\n1996-97 season is interesting, because we lost the first and last game of the season to the same team, Arizona (see table below). Not quite the same setting, but I remember feeling so bad for Michigan State team back in 2008-09 season when we beat them twice, first quite early in the season (but not the season opener), and later in the season finale in Detroit. So it must have been really depressing for the team and the fans to start and end the season that way, losing twice to the same team.\nAnd there’s that 2004-05 season opener loss to Santa Clara, but we know there’s a happy ending to this one, so I won’t go into much details for that season here. I know there is that 2001-02 season opener loss to Hampton too, but I’m pretending it didn’t even exist for obvious reason. I know it’s not fair, and that season (and failures leading up to the season) probably deserves a separate post in the future.\n\n\n\nSeason's Last Game\n\n\nSeason\nGame_Date\nType\nWhere\nOpponent_School\nResult\nTm\nOpp\n\n\n\n\n1966\n1966-03-04\nCTOURN\nN\nDuke\nL\n20\n21\n\n\n1983\n1983-03-27\nNCAA\nN\nGeorgia\nL\n77\n82\n\n\n1997\n1997-03-29\nNCAA\nN\nArizona\nL\n58\n66\n\n\n2002\n2002-03-08\nCTOURN\nN\nDuke\nL\n48\n60\n\n\n2005\n2005-04-04\nNCAA\nN\nIllinois\nW\n75\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust out of curiosity, I looked for seasons where the first and last game was played against the same team, and it turns out since 1949-50 season, 1996-97 season was the only such season."
